# Plug.OnMaintenance

_Enable maintenance mode for your Plug based Elixir applications._

**Plug.OnMaintenance**, an Elixir Plug, is used to disable access to your application for some length of time. Putting application in maintenance mode can be done programmatically or via mix tasks.

## Installation

For whatever reason, you want your Plug based Elixir application to be in maintenance mode for some length of time. `Plug.OnMaintenance` is what you need.

Add `on_maitnenance` to your project dependencies in mix.exs:

```exs
defp deps do
  [
    ...
    {:on_maintenance, "~> 0.5"}
  ]
end
```

and do

```bash
mix deps.get
```

In case of error, you may want to do

```bash
mix deps.update --all
```

## Setup

Now that you have `on_maintenance` as your dependency, plug `Plug.OnMaintenance` in your `router.ex`. Let us say we have a Phoenix application.

```elixir
pipeline :api do
  plug Plug.OnMaintenance
  # ...
end
```

Then run this mix task

```bash
mix maintenance.init_config_store # creates sqlite db and add initial state of application (which is "not in maintenance mode")
```

Then run the application

```bash
mix phoenix.server # just in local
```

You can enable/disable maintenance mode for your application via mix tasks below

```bash
mix maintenance.enable
mix maintenance.disable
```

Or programmatically using these convenience methods below

```elixir
import Plug.OnMaintenance.Util

on_maintenance?()     # will check if application is in maintenance mode
enable_maintenance()  # put application in maintenance mode
disable_maintenance() # disable maintenance mode
```

## **retry-after** response header
`503` response code should have a `retry-after` [header](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html).

You can enable maintenance mode for your application and can
specify how long it would take via `--retry-after` option!

```bash
mix maintenance.enable --retry-after=300 # application will be on maintenance for 5 minutes.
```

## Example 503 responses (default)

When in maintenance mode, your application will respond 503 to all http requests. The default message is _"application on scheduled maintenance."_. Examples:

### text/html response
```html
<html>
  <body>Application on scheduled maintenance.</body>
</html>
```

### application/json response
```json
{"message": "Application on scheduled maintenance."}
```

### text/plain response
```text
Application on scheduled maintenance.
```

## Custom 503 Message

Default message can be updated via `config.exs`

```elixir
use Mix.Config

# ...

config :on_maintenance,
  message: "Service is currently in maintenance mode. Give us few minutes. Thanks!"
```
